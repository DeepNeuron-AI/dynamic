Parser will create a NameSpace object (whatever that is). 

Probable current workflow for the code:

define EchoClient class
define client function
Define a "setup" function which returns parameters?

At least have a Configure_dataloaders which partitions data and returns parameters.


FIGURE OUT how to define the train function, whether this needs to be something more than just the Run_epoch?
- if Fit is just calling train with a set params and epochs = 1, then we CAN just substitute Run Epoch instead I think
