# TO DO ITEMS
- [x] remove actual html data in the current html templates by commenting them out and displaying hello worrld
- [x] set up a python flask database to store the web page comments in there 
- [x] you have set up the database and you have been able to put values into the database (I think although i'm not super sure.. like where is this database even kept?? actually it's under instance folder where it says comments.db) and then lastly you just need to display the database onto the web page, which is not working atm. 
- [x] using this for loop given by chat is decent but only displays first few rows, now we just need to have it all be displayed. I need to change the logic so that it displays all the comments immediately which will require a separate python function connected to the database to do this. And then basically whenever we get a POST method, it will reupdate this table to showcase the new comment as well, ie. to add the comment and then simply reload the database. 
- [x] have these instance form views remember the comments that were left on that page. Allow it to have these comments reloaded each time that the instance is opened up. I assume this will require a more complex database backend connection that displays these comments each time that specific instance is opened. 
- [ ] research how to create authentication and users 
- [ ] look into moving this database into google cloud. 
- [ ] turn the .py stuff into cloud functions that can run on google servers instead of my computer 
- [ ] Look into embedding google forms vs adding textboxes. 
-  [ ] add those google forms that allow you to write reports into a specific instance. 
- [ ] add authentication so that people have to login 
- [ ] Await for Norrisa to help fix billing account 
- [ ] add website security?
- [ ]  deploy the website on google app engine
