# TO DO ITEMS
- [x] remove actual html data in the current html templates by commenting them out and displaying hello worrld
- [ ] set up a python flask database to store the web page comments in there 
- [ ] have these instance form views remember the comments that were left on that page. Allow it to have these comments reloaded each time that the instance is opened up. I assume this will require a more complex database backend connection that displays these comments each time that specific instance is opened. 
- [ ] look into moving this database into google cloud. 
- [ ] turn the .py stuff into cloud functions that can run on google servers instead of my computer 
- [ ] Look into embedding google forms vs adding textboxes. 
-  [ ] add those google forms that allow you to write reports into a specific instance. 
- [ ] add authentication so that people have to login 
- [ ] Await for Norrisa to help fix billing account 
- [ ] add website security?
- [ ]  deploy the website on google app engine
